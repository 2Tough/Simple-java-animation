# Simple-Java-Animation
 A simple onClick animation in which an image appears randomly on screen while increasing/decreasing size. If clicks are registered not on the spaceman icon, 
 then points get deducted from your score. This project helped me understand how to properly set up intents, splash activity and how to wire the layouts with
 the corresponding files.
 
 There's a welcome page (splash), game page and game over page.
